# **Student Depression Detection System**  
### *Python | scikit-learn | pandas | MySQL *  

---

## **📌 Project Overview**  
The **Student Depression Detection System** is a machine learning-based project that analyzes behavioral and psychological indicators to predict potential signs of depression among students. The system applies educational data analytics to enable early identification and data-driven mental health interventions.

---

## **🎯 Objectives**  

- Build a reliable machine learning classification model for mental health prediction.  
- Analyze student behavioral data to identify risk patterns.  
- Apply learner analytics in educational data science.  
- Support cognitive-aware, evidence-based student wellbeing interventions.

## **📊 Dataset & Features**  

The model was trained using behavioral and academic indicators such as:  

- Study habits  
- Sleep patterns  
- Social engagement  
- Academic performance  
- Stress levels  
- Attendance behavior  

*(Dataset was cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed before training.)*
